# Regression Basics[![View Regression Basics on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/93435-regression-basics)  
**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2020a. Compatible with R2020a and later releases._  

## Description ##
This package contains a [live script](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) and supporting files to illustrate some basics of regression analysis. The materials are designed to be flexible and can be easily modified to accommodate a variety of teaching and learning methods. We include a brief background, interactive illustrations, tasks, reflection questions, a real-world application example, and a guided exercise for the concepts explored.

**Learning Goals**
- Define linear, nonlinear, and multiple linear regression.
- Assess and improve the performance of a regression model using a goodness-of-fit measure.
- Apply gradient descent to minimize a cost function.
- Explain the effect of increasing and decreasing the learning rate and number of steps for gradient descent.
- Apply a linear regression model to perform short-term forecasting.

## Suggested Prework ## 
[MATLAB Onramp](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html) – a free two-hour introductory tutorial to learn the essentials of MATLAB®.  

## Details ##

**`regressionBasics.mlx`**  
An interactive lesson that introduces the fundamentals of regression analysis. Students apply basic linear regression to model real-world electricity load data.

## ##
**`electricityLoadData.mlx`**  
A supplementary script to download the external electricity load data from [New York ISO](http://mis.nyiso.com/public/) for use in the practice problem.  

## ##
**`regressSolnIm/`**  
This folder includes supplementary image files containing solutions for tasks in `regressionBasics.mlx`. The main script provides controls to hide or expose the solutions when needed. Ensure that this folder is in the same location as `regressionBasics.mlx`
